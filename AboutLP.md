# Why Literate Programming? #

Most of programmers writes many unformal documentation while developing some project: in special notebook, with color pens, with schemes and diagrams. It's something like designer's "desktops". But after finishing coding, this notebooks usually are lost. And only POST-CODDING docs are kept. And also code comments ;)

Program is "live" while it's SUPPORTABLE. And supporters needs to know not only result code but IDEAS, SOLUTIONS, TRICKS, ALGORITHMS and many other - all thoughts from working notebooks of developers.

Literate Programming aims to acomplish two main goals:
  * minimize bugs (because of clean coding style with describing ALL logic and relations in native, human text with possible pictures and so on)
  * produce supportable programs
